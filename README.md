# 3rdYearWebDevelopmentAndDatabasesProject2

This project has been developed in python using flask and MariaDB.

The purpose of this project was to create a review website for
movies. The website can display the reviews, users and movies by
writing to and from a SQL database that I have originally made
using MariaDB that the website logs into it using DBcm commands.
